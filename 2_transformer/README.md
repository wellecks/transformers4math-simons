This notebook implements and trains a simple transformer language model.

**NOTE:** if you only want to train a transformer on a dataset and generate with it, *you can safely skip this notebook and move to the next one*. This notebook shows lower-level details of implementing a transformer and a training loop. It assumes some familiarity with PyTorch and neural network training.
